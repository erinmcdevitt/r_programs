## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Load required packages
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)

# Create some sample data
set.seed(123)
data <- data.frame(
  Category = rep(LETTERS[1:4], each = 10),
  Value = rnorm(40)
)

# Create a list to store the charts
charts <- list()

# Generate the four charts and store them in the list
for (i in 1:4) {
  chart <- ggplot(data, aes(x = Category, y = Value)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
    ggtitle(paste("Chart", i)) +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
  
  charts[[i]] <- chart
}

# Create the grid of charts
grid <- plot_grid(plotlist = charts, ncol = 2)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r # Output the chart grid}

print(grid)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
